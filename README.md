# T800-Project

T800 Project is a small framework I started developing for multiple purposes,
one of them, was to teach the basics of graphics programming. Now is at the
stage of supporting some functionality like:

- Loading .X files
- Basic Camera
- Rendering with D3D11 and GLES2.0
- Diffuse/Specular/Gloss/Normal Map/Fresnel

Is still on development, much work needs to be done. I am working on this at my spare time
so improvements will come slowly. Feel free to use and improve.
